# AI Searches Visualization

This repository contains Python implementations of  search algorithms with Tkinter-based GUI visualizations, designed for an AI class project. Each algorithm demonstrates step-by-step traversal of a fixed search tree from node A to node N.

## Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores level-by-level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores deeply along each branch.
- **Limited Depth-First Search (DLS)**: DFS with a depth limit.
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**: Iteratively increases depth limit.
- **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**: Explores by lowest path cost.
- **Bidirectional Search (UCS)**: Start Exploring from both start and goal.



## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with standard Python)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/search-algorithms-visualization.git
   ```
2. Run File:
   ```
   python T.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run a Python file (e.g., `python bfs.py`).
- Select Algorithm and click "Run" to see the algorithm’s execution.
